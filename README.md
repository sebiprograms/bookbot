# bookbot
A text analyzer made with python

## About
This project was create so that I can quickly get information on text files as needed. The inspiration comes from the 'wc' command in bash
linux. I've been learning a lot of new commands for linux bash and want
to try to recreate more to get a better understanding of them.
